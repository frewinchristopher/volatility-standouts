A cron-style node app that generates a human-like mp3 recording via Google's cloud text-to-speech api for streaming on the Alexa platform, after every market trading day at market close.

It should install and run with two simple steps:

1. Install node modules: `npm install`
2. Run the report generator: `node index.js`
